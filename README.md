The world is moving fast and we are constantly left wanting for time and finding out things that can be postponed or cancelled just because we run out of time in the day. They say every second counts and we considered this saying in the best of  letter and spirit. We normally spend about 20-25 minutes in-front of a mirror in our daily lives. We planned to make this time also productive and useful to the person using the mirror. We are moving towards a world with smart things and appliances. In the proposed idea we present an Interactive Smart Mirror with various features to make sure that every minute of the user is utilized properly. The smart mirror will be acting as a Personal Digital Assistant providing day-today schedule and appointments pulling the information from the users account, it is also capable of displaying real time information such as live weather updates, local time of a particular location and also helps the person to get in touch with the current affairs happening around the world. The Smart Mirror would help in developing smart houses with embedded artificial intelligence, as well as finding its applications in industries. Further, the mirror can also be used to control anything with your voice as it also gets Virtual Voice Assistant services.
